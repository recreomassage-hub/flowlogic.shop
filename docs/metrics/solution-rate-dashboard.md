## 🎯 Target Values

### Solution Rate
- **Target:** ≥ 70%
- **Warning:** 60-70% (below target, but acceptable)
- **Alert:** < 60% (action required)

### False Positive Rate
- **Target:** < 20%
- **Warning:** 20-30% (calibration needed)
- **Alert:** > 30% (significant calibration required)

## 📋 Interpretation Guide

### Solution Rate

**What it measures:**
- Percentage of reported bugs that were actually fixed
- Higher is better (indicates effective bug fixing process)

**Why it matters:**
- Protects against alert fatigue
- Indicates trust in bug detection system
- Shows effectiveness of bug fixing workflow

**How to improve:**
- Reduce false positives (improve bug detection accuracy)
- Increase fix rate (improve bug fixing process)
- Better triage (prioritize fixable bugs)

### False Positive Rate

**What it measures:**
- Percentage of reported bugs that were invalid (not actual bugs)
- Lower is better (indicates accurate bug detection)

**Why it matters:**
- High false positive rate reduces trust in system
- Wastes developer time on non-issues
- Indicates need for calibration

**How to improve:**
- Calibrate bug detection rules
- Improve OpenSpec rule definitions
- Better filtering of edge cases

## 📝 Notes

- Metrics are calculated from Beads issues with `issue_type: "bug"`
- Solution Rate = `total_fixed / total_reported * 100`
- False Positive Rate = `total_invalid / total_reported * 100`
- Metrics are updated on each run of `calculate-solution-rate.sh`
